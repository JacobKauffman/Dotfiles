If you have issues using anything here or something is broken let me know and I will be glad to help you out!

So I will explain what some of this stuff is and why I use it.

### Terminal Emulator
I use rxvt-unicode or urxvt. It is my favoirte terminal emulator and is extremely lightweight. The reason I use it is because of simplicity and compatibility as well as customization. It also works great with pywal!

### Ranger
Ranger is a great terminal file manager and I prefer to use it over any gui file manager. It is super intuitive and easy to use and there are some great features that gui file managers just don't have. As you might have seen in my reddit post I can use ranger with pywal to do some sick things.

### Conclusion
So why do I use all of these terminal applications and why do I even use i3 in the first place? Well the answer to that is, it is fun! There is just so much stuff you can do and there is a lot more freedom. i3 is also just a great alternative to a DE because of how convienient it is.
